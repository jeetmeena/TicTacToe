This is an app to play the famous Tic Tac Toe game on Android in a material design way. You can play against a human player or against the computer which uses a minimax algorithm and is undefeatable as it pre-empts your moves and makes its move based on that, meaning at best means that you can only draw. 

For 2 player games, Min and Max players are assigned. Minimax uses a tree that assigns values to each combination of moves possible. One Player tries to dictate the game and tend the game to the highest value in the tree(win). The Min player tries to do the opposite as their goal is opposite to their opponent as they are trying to beat them. We assume logical choices are made by both players since theyre both trying to win for themselves. Tries to minimise the value of the tree. So the max player knows this and chooses the path through the tree that will give it the largest value which the minimum player will try to go through too. The players are alternated between min and max as in the game. The max player chooses the lowest possible value of nodes for opponents moves, then chooses the maximum of those branches, which forces the opponent to play the move that will benefit the max player everytime, and keeps doing this recursively until the match is over. Leaf nodes get value -1 if opponent wins, 0 for draw and +1 for win. Foresees all possible moves so you can never win as it chooses the best values for it to win and you to lose. 

Alpha-beta pruning can be used to speed it up, as it uses less move computation but it is not necessary for tic tac toe since a tree depth is shallow. Ignores certain paths of the tree whereas the minimax calculates every single node. ABP tries to reduce the nodes evaluated by the minimax algorithm. Cuts away branches that cannot possibly influence the final decision. Stops when it finds a possibility worse than a previously examined move. Pruning reduces size of trees by removing branches that do not provide any more relevant information. Reduces time/improve accuracy less noise.
